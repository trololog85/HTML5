		<h1>Subaru Impreza 2015<h1>
		<h2><strong>Refreshed for 2015 on underpinnings that were all-new in 2012</strong>, the Subaru Impreza is the company’s least expensive offering, but it also lends its platform to other models including the Forester crossover, the XV Crosstrek and, of most interest to Car and Driver, the WRX</h2>

			<p>The Impreza is sensible, spacious, and trustworthy—traits you might want in a spouse, but not for a weekend date. Nonetheless, it now sports an interior with upgraded materials and added sound-silencing. A 148-hp 2.0-liter four teams up with all-wheel drive and either a five-speed manual or a CVT. The Impreza provides confident all-weather transport and plenty of space for people and cargo, especially as a four-door hatchback. All-wheel drive makes the Impreza unique but alas, it isn’t enough.</p>
